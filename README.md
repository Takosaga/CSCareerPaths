# CSCareerPaths
An app to show cs careers paths and courses available to students in my district.
This is the first project I worked on after finishing 100 days of hacking with SwiftUI.

# Why?
Since most of my students have iphones and students don't know that there are many options for careers in Computer Science not just programmers. Wanted to make an app to increase enrollement into CS in the school district.
